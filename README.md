# Project: MyFridge
## Introduction
Being college students ourselves, we encountered the problem of throwing away food because they were expired. Sharing food with others would greatly reduce the food wastage.
The web allows students like ourselves to log on, offer food that they do not need to share with their hall mates. In addition, it gives students a platform to connect with each other. What is a better way to connect than through food?

## Building framework/languages
We used a mixture of html, php, css, and mySQL.

## Challenges
Being first years, we were all unsure of how to create a new website. Hence we were unsure how to start the project. Learning how to use the different platforms was one of the biggest challenges that we faced. We had many ideas and extensions that we wanted to implement but we were unsure of how to do so with the limited technical knowledge that we had. With the mentors' help, we were able to broaden our horizon and learn more about the different aspects of interface and web development software.

## Future
We wish to further develop it into a phone application, with more features. (e.g. community groups) We would like to extend the software to cater to other students who are not living in halls as well. For example, house mates options: sharing household chores.
